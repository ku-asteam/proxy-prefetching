# Intentionality-related Long Short term memory (Ir-LSTM)

Ir-LSTM is an intentionality-related prediction model based on deep learning method in web prefetching.

## Introduction

`RNN_pytorch.py`

- Web requests analysis from time serires data set
- generating prefetching sequences using LSTM and SoftMax function
- Providing vizulization to show the heat map of 2 variables
- Testing all the possible results in different threshold and different number of targets

# Requirements

* *Unix-based operating systems
* Python3
* Libraries: `Gensim`, `numpy`, and `Pytorch`
* The visualizing part are supported by `matplotlib`

  *Tips: If import errors happen, just use the pip3 to install the corresponding lib*

## Instruction

* How to run
    1. `python RNN_pytorch.py`
